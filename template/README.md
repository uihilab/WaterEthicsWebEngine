# Learn the Framework Structure

To build an experimental use case researchers supply three files: 
- `index.php`,
- `site_meta.json`, and
- `scenarios.json`.
Researchers must also supply images that will be used with each scenario.

Here in the `template/` subdirectory, you will find descriptions and examples of each file and dummy images in their proper locations.
For an example of the hosted product of this framework, **[go here](https://hydroinformatics.uiowa.edu/lab/WaterEthicsWebEngine/template/)**.

## `index.php`
This file is served when users navigate to your experiment.
It starts a session and then calls to include code from `app/php/`.
See the readme file under `app/` for more information on these files.

```php
<?php

// Start a session within the local directory
session_start();

// ---- Connect to DB ----
include '../app/php/database.php';
// -----------------------

// General rest of application
include '../app/php/engine.php';

?>
```
# JSON Files
**![figure image](https://github.com/uihilab/WaterEthicsWebEngine/raw/master/_readme-figs/_ScenarioKeyDemo.png)**
*The figure above shows how the different elements in the files `site_meta.json` and `scenarios.json` are used*

## `site_meta.json`
The `site_meta.json` file contains static data and metadata required by the application engine to serve an experiment to users.
Its structure provides descriptive keys that prompt the developerâ€™s intended input. 
Examples of static inputs are `title`, `aggregateExplanation`, and `comparitorButton`.
Refer to the image above.

The rest of the information in `site_meta.json` is used dynamically for gameplay experience, or in communication with the database and backend.
- `buildKey` is an integer that is unique to each experiment. The app engine uses `buildKey` to identify different experimental results on the database side.
- In the `scenarios` array the developer dictates the total number of scenarios there are to choose from, `nTot`, and how many of these to deliver to the user, `nServe`.
(The exact scenarios from the set and their order are determined upon launch using a random shuffling algorithm.)
- The `infoBar` array describes both the content and styling of the infobars (generated for each of the scenario descriptions via a mustache js template in `/app/engine.php`.) **Note: the length of the list `categories` must match the number `nCategories`, both supplied in `infoBar` array.** 

## `scenarios.json`
All scenario data included in the application are provided in the file `scenarios.json`.
The data structure of this file is an array of objects where each object is a single scenario with three name/value pairs:
- `id` : any string, unique from the other names of the scenarios in the current experiment,
- `Left-Panel`: a json object containing the information as the *left* option in the scenario, and
- `Right-Panel`: a json object containing the information as the *right* option in the scenario.

Each panel (left or right) includes the following name/value pairs:
- `img_path`: string of filename located **within the `images/` subdirectory** of the project directory,
- `descr` : string which gives a text description of the scenario, and
- `barValues` : an array of values. The length of the array is equal to `nCategories` and the values at each index correspond to the category at each index of `categories` (described in `site_meta.json`.)

A sample scenario entry can be found below:
```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "Left-Panel": {
      "img_path": "imagePathForLeftPanel.png",
      "descr": "Here is a text description of the left-panel of scenario sample1. Provide the user more context to scenario.",
      "barValues": [8,2,1,0,3]
    },
    "Right-Panel": {
      "img_path": "imagePathForRightPanel.png",
      "descr": "Here is a text description of the right-panel of scenario sample1. Provide the user more context to scenario.",
      "barValues": [2,8,2,0,3]
    }
  }
```
