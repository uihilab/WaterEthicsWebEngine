# Offline Analytics 
`_analytics/` contains python code to analyze results and build preference models.
The intended workflow is as follows:
- query experimental data from database associated with experiment,
- aggregate and investigate raw data,
- learn preference models from data,
- use preference models in other decision-making contexts, and
- investigate impact of model decision-making behavior.
